# Race for Water: Ocean and Human Body Parallels Application

### Project Overview
The **Race for Water** foundation, established in 2010 by Swiss entrepreneur Marco Simeoni, is dedicated to ocean conservation. Known for its global "OdyssÃ©es" aboard innovative ships, the foundation has been studying the impact of plastic pollution on ecosystems and human health for over a decade. In 2024, Race for Water embarked on a new mission with the MODX 70 catamaran, focusing on oceans and climate change. The goal is to highlight the importance of decarbonizing maritime transport and maintaining healthy oceans.

This project aimed to develop an educational and interactive web application for the Nuit de l'Info 2024. The app explores the fascinating parallels between the human body and the ocean, focusing on how both systems function and how dysfunction in one can affect the other.

### Mission and Objective
The task was to create a web application illustrating the connections between the human body and the ocean, enabling users to explore these parallels in an engaging and interactive way. The app focuses on key elements of both systems, demonstrating their interdependence, and raises awareness about the importance of ocean preservation.

## Key Features:
- Interactive model showing parallels between the human body and the ocean, such as:

  - Heart = Circulatory System (Ocean currents & Thermohaline pump)
  - Lungs = Gas Exchange Function (Photosynthesis & COâ‚‚ absorption)
  - Plankton = Small Marine Life (Immune System)
  - Coral = Biodiversity (Organs/Defense Mechanisms)
  - And many more comparisons...
  
- Educational descriptions and explanations of each parallel, with multimedia content (audio, video, and podcasts).

- Integration of audio/video content provided via the official Discord server of Nuit de lâ€™Info, including a podcast format with a jingle.

- Easy integration into the Race for Water website, adaptable for events and interactive displays.

- Mobile-oriented interface, allowing users to access it through QR codes on promotional materials.

## App Constraints:
- Mobile First: Designed for mobile devices, with a landscape view for events.
- User Accessibility: Easy-to-navigate interface for various audiences.
- Scalability: Application should be easy to embed and integrate on the foundationâ€™s website or event screens.
## Development Team
The project was developed by a dedicated team of developers:

- [LittleMoonie](https://github.com/LittleMoonie)
- [Fat2Nash](https://github.com/Fat2Nash)
- [LenaGonzalezBreton](https://github.com/LenaGonzalezBreton)
- [MichelBKT](https://github.com/MichelBKT)
- [thedarkman195](https://github.com/thedarkman195)

## Challenges and Bonuses
During the Nuit de l'Info 2024, the team participated in several challenges to enhance the project's functionality and user engagement:

1. **Lyreco Management â€“ "Ã€ la chasse au logo!"**
- Developed an interactive website where a Lyreco logo appears randomly, providing a fun and engaging experience for users.

2. **Capgemini Pau â€“ "Cookie Cauchemar"**
- Created a deliberately frustrating cookie clicker game with a nightmarish user interface, adding a humorous element to the application.

3. **Viveris â€“ "Game Tcha: le CAPTCHA ludique"**
- Designed a mini-game inspired by gaming culture to replace traditional CAPTCHAs, making the verification process more engaging.

4. **Sopra Steria MÃ©rignac â€“ "L'ergonomie : simplifier pour mieux vivre"**
- Implemented a deliberately complex input field to challenge users, highlighting the importance of user-friendly design.

5. **La French Tech Littoral HDF â€“ "On va jouer Ã  un jeu"**
- Introduced an innovative gamification system to encourage user interaction and repeat visits to the application.

## Conclusion
By creating this interactive, educational web application, the team aimed to foster a deeper understanding of the crucial role the ocean plays in regulating life on Earth. The project educates users about the vital need to protect the ocean while illustrating the parallels between the ocean's health and the human body's well-being. Through immersive interaction, the team hopes to inspire collective responsibility and encourage actions to protect the ocean, ensuring a healthy planet for future generations.
